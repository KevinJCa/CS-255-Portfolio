## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project consisted of two parts where I took the role as a system's analyst for the theoritical "DriverPass" company. The first part required completing a business requirements document that would capture DriverPass's needs. As well as providing a brief analysis emphasizing on a process and object-modeling approach towards desiging the system. DriverPass desired a system where student drivers are able to purchase student driver packages offering in-person training along with online courses and practice tests. Online appointments could be reserved separately, recorded through unique accounts pertaining to each student that would be registered within the system.

## What did you do particularly well?

I was able to capture most if not all of the requirements for the company based on an interview transcript between the representatives of my theoritical consulting company and representatives from the client, DriverPass. While placing each requirement categorized as functional/non-functional, with only those that should be prioritized for an adequate functional system. I also found the development of the UML diagrams illustrating the interaction between the entities of the system and its processes to have gone particularly well. The designs were kept simple, yet detailed enough to emphasize on every class or object with their interactions and relationships with other objects or processes responsible for completing certain tasks to satsify the company's needs.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Both, the UML sequence as well as class diagrams could use further revision, ensuring that UML symbols were properly used and depict their intended representation for the system's different interactions. More classes and functions within existing classes could be added to the class diagram to completely represent the system's design.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs were taken into consideration in conjuction with the company's intended vision for the system. If a user's needs are not met, then losses will occur for the either company, whether it be as a developer or the client's business. As a developer, it's important to think as a user for the system if user's aren't being involved to prototype or test the system before its final build. A system must also contain an element of abstraction where the intricacies of a system is kept from the user, so they can focus on obtaining their needs, rather than having to worry about how the system provides its services.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I take an iterative, more agile approach for developing software. Incrementally desiging each element of a system through use-cases within an allotted amount of time. Aiming towards a functional deliverable rather than a perfect, bug-free build that would only prolong development. Planning should be brief and only generalize each objective as there will be unpredictable variables during a project's development pipeline which will need quick adaptation as a developer. Less amount of time spent on planning allows more time for actual development. An important technique when analyzing and designing a system, would be to incorporate an effective feedback loop between a client and the development team. Not only is receiving the needs of a company important, but also the opinions of the client or potential users as features are being developed. This allows changes to be made earlier on, allowing for flexibility and transparency on the product that is being developed. Both the user and the company responsible will know what to expect once it's fully released.
